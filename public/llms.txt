## Notable Insights
- "AI doesn't read paragraphs the way humans do. It scans for the quickest, clearest answer to quote verbatim."
- "Every paragraph must be a standalone answer to a single question. No fluff. No meandering intros."
- "Keep each paragraph under 80 words and focused on a single question. Lead with the answer."
- "Stop writing fluff. If your paragraphs don't give AI the exact answer within the first sentence, they're worthless."

## Content Philosophy
Advocates for direct, no-fluff content that prioritizes:
- Answer-first paragraph structure
- Single-idea focus per paragraph
- Front-loaded data and statistics
- Question-style headings that match user queries
- Atomic content units that can be quoted independently
